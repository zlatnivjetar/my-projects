# Webpage with Parallax effect
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At first, I planned to make parallax effect for practice, but ended up making the entire webpage from scratch.

The page in my opinion has a decent layout, design elements, colors and some nice effects that contribute to better UX.

Making the effect was the easy part, and the hardest part was to make it responsive across multiple devices.

The bottom part will not look great on every single device,including large monitors, but I believe it should work well on most.

Considering my overall structure of the elements is not perfect, and I am still relatively new to the coding world, I am satisfied with my work.
